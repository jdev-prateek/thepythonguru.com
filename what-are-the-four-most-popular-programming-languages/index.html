<p>For a beginner who is seeking to step into the software development industry, the very first thing that arises in their mind is to know where to start from. This is indeed an important thing to contemplate as this may determine the entire career prospect of a software industry aspirant. It is also not that easy to choose out one most favorable programming language as their first programming language to learn. People should never follow the hearsays in this concern as they would only know languages which were favorable to others’ career, which can not be the same case for you. One of the most sophisticated ways to choose a programming language to study its overview, ratings and related blogs or articles on the internet, and can also ask experienced professionals working in the same technologies about their experiences.</p><p>After starting the journey as a programmer, one comes to know about the idiosyncrasies and complexities of a language and then find different ways to tackle its challenges. Alongside, this also helps one to explore their interests and career goals in that particular technology.</p><p>In this sequence, we are here to discuss some of the most popular and high-ranked programming languages with an intent to clarify the significance of these languages in the industry. Most of these languages would be used in different services including <a href="https://krademy.com/the-ultimate-web-designing-course" rel="nofollow" >web development</a>, mobile application development, game development, and other software applications.</p><span id="javascript" class="anchor-target"></span><h2 class="heading">JavaScript <a class="header-link" href="index.html#javascript">#</a></h2><hr>
<p>It is no surprise that JavaScript tops our list of industry’s most popular programming languages. It has been integrated in many open-source projects, experiencing unprecedented and immense growth in the industry.</p><p>There are many particular reasons for JavaScript being used in most of the open-source projects these days.</p><p>It is amongst the essential front-end web development technologies such as HTML and CSS. Furthermore, the world’s most popular websites like Facebook, Twitter, Gmail and YouTube utilize JavaScript to develop interactive user-interfaces and platforms to display dynamic content to viewers.</p><p>However, it acts primarily as a front-end language being run on the browsers, it is also utilized on server-side through Node.js to create scalable network applications. Since it has flexible syntax and compatibility to all major browsers, it is also considered one of the most used programming languages these days.</p><span id="python" class="anchor-target"></span><h2 class="heading">Python <a class="header-link" href="index.html#python">#</a></h2><hr>
<p>Python is acclaimed to be the most significant programming language of these days as it is being used in a variety of applications such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, big data, cybersecurity and robotics. The most significant advantage a new python learner leverages is its clear, intuitive and english-like syntax making it a popular choice amongst beginners.</p><p>Packages like NumPy and SciPy facilitate users to engage utilize Python in scientific computing, advanced mathematics and engineering. Users can also develop robust data science, machine learning, image processing and computer vision programs by utilizing other advanced libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn and OpenCV.</p><p>Python has leveraged a steady growth in the last decade with a record-breaking recognition by entering the cabinet of top 5 technologies in Tiobe Index some years ago. Interested learners can take <a href="https://krademy.com/complete-python-programming-course">online python course training</a> to explore this advanced and popular technology.</p><span id="java" class="anchor-target"></span><h2 class="heading">Java <a class="header-link" href="index.html#java">#</a></h2><hr>
<p>Java has been a mainstream programming language for decades. It was introduced as a general-purpose language and gained immense popularity because of its “Write Once, Run Anywhere” (WORA) approach. Java is a platform-independent programming language whose programs can be run on any platform after compilation. Being equipped with Java Virtual Machine (JVM), it has been one of the foremost technologies indulging the concept of cross-platform compatibility into the process.</p><p>Java is also an origination base for Android operating system and has provided it a common language platform to develop robust Android applications. It has also engaged a large enterprise base where it occupies 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies to be used to develop advanced applications and backend systems.</p><p>Alongside, notable Apache Hadoop data processing system has been coded in Java and is run through Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Windows Azure. It has been proven a best-in-class programming language in terms of flexibility, modularity and comprehensibility.</p><span id="cc" class="anchor-target"></span><h2 class="heading">C/C++ <a class="header-link" href="index.html#cc">#</a></h2><hr>
<p>C is considered to be the mother of modern-programming languages. A number of languages are either completely derived from C or have their syntaxes, constructs and paradigms looked alike as that of C. Some of such languages comprise Java, Objective-C and C#. It has been a constructive technology behind many high-performance applications such as Linux operating system and many prominent embedded systems.</p><p><a href="https://krademy.com/C++-programming-language-course" rel="nofollow" >C++ programming language</a> is one of the most direct successors of C. C++, which was also developed on C, acquires a number of same advantages. C++ is an object-oriented programming language and a popular alternative to develop computer graphics, video games and virtual reality even today. It has been and still being used in different places starting from personalized operating systems to advanced mainframes. Google uses C++ to empower its particular resource-oriented operations. It has been empowering embedded systems like modern-age AI devices increasing its overall popularity in the industry.</p><p>Author Bio - Jyoti Yadav has 3+ years of industrial experience as a Digital Marketing Analyst and Passionate Writer. She is currently working in Krademy.com, one of the largest online instructor-led training institution established in India.
