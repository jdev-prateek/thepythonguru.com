<p>2019 is going to be quite exciting and promising for all the web app developers as there have been phenomenal progress and incredible advancements in 2018. Everyone is looking forward to playing with these amazing new toys in the circuit and come up with some fabulous products. Here are some of the predictions relating to web application development in 2019.</p><span id="trend-javascript-would-become-more-widespread-amp-dominant" class="anchor-target"></span><h2 class="heading">Trend: JavaScript Would Become More Widespread &amp; Dominant <a class="header-link" href="index.html#trend-javascript-would-become-more-widespread-amp-dominant">#</a></h2><hr>
<p>This is the sixth consecutive year and JavaScript yet again has been voted by the user-base of Stack Overflow as the most popular and preferred programming language. As per <a href="https://www.codingdojo.com" rel="nofollow" >https://www.codingdojo.com</a>, “JavaScript is still the most popular language for the last six years, and it continues to develop according to Stack Overflow 2018 report. The evolution of its frameworks, libraries, and designs for the past years proved that it has lots to offer in the market. No wonder it is developer’s top pick language for it provides a whole new experience of flexibility, challenge, and power.” The JavaScript community seems to be coming up with incredible open-source libraries, documentation, and components for its consumers. Learning JavaScript was never so much fun and easier. JavaScript is highly recommended for all budding web designers who are wondering which language to choose.</p><span id="trend-preference-for-going-server-less-for-scaling-apps" class="anchor-target"></span><h2 class="heading">Trend: Preference for Going Server-less for Scaling Apps <a class="header-link" href="index.html#trend-preference-for-going-server-less-for-scaling-apps">#</a></h2><hr>
<p>We have witnessed that the popularity of and preference for server-less architecture has grown phenomenally throughout the year 2018, and there are distinct signs that the trend would continue well into 2019. Hosting providers such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are constantly fighting and competing over market share. They have a definite focus on server-less architecture. Google Firebase and AWS Lambda are supposed to be two fabulous instances of the way server-less architecture would be assisting developers in focusing on writing code without worrying about spinning up, monitoring, deploying, scaling, and maintaining servers.</p><p>These services boast of splendid features that could handle practically every imaginable use-case. You just need to hook your application straightaway to the server-less offerings from a reputed company of your preference and go ahead and deploy your application with only a few clicks.</p><p>Everything seems to be already optimized for you depending on the kind of data you would be serving, if you are having an application that is read-heavy particularly on its database side, or an application which is known to store and serve lots of pictures, the underlying architecture would certainly ensure scalability, speed, and affordability by effectively using the top resources for your job. Seek assistance from any reputed and reliable <a href="https://www.bigdropinc.com/digital-marketing/" rel="nofollow" >digital marketing agency</a> for professional services and perfect web application solutions.</p><span id="trend-fringe-technologies-such-as-typescript-amp-graphql-will-be-witnessing-a-boost-in-adoption" class="anchor-target"></span><h2 class="heading">Trend: Fringe Technologies Such As Typescript &amp; GraphQL Will Be Witnessing a Boost in Adoption <a class="header-link" href="index.html#trend-fringe-technologies-such-as-typescript-amp-graphql-will-be-witnessing-a-boost-in-adoption">#</a></h2><hr>
<p>Many people had forecasted that Typescript and GraphQL would be taking off in 2018. Even though both witnessed an increase in user growth, a number of people were hesitant and not comfortable about using them in their live projects. But as 2018 was drawing to a close, we could witness a tremendous increase in interest about these two technologies and people interested in these two technologies were also, pretty clear about the associated benefits. Both Typescript &amp; GraphQL is supposed to be a ‘type system query language’. We know that Typescript assists in adding robust types to JavaScript. In fact, they would be adding robustness and ease of development to the apps for web developers who are not interested in writing complex queries while delivering optimized and scalable outcomes. You may rely on Typescript &amp; GraphQL for taking huge leaps forward in 2019.</p><span id="trend-ai-amp-machine-learning-would-become-gradually-more-pervasive-with-web-applications" class="anchor-target"></span><h2 class="heading">Trend: AI &amp; Machine Learning Would Become Gradually More Pervasive with Web Applications <a class="header-link" href="index.html#trend-ai-amp-machine-learning-would-become-gradually-more-pervasive-with-web-applications">#</a></h2><hr>
<p>Initially, we have witnessed AI and machine learning using huge data-sets and providing analysis accordingly. However, with the introduction of JavaScript-based libraries of machine learning like Google’s Tensorflow.js, and brain.js, today incorporating machine learning into your web apps is simple and easy just like importing JavaScript libraries. If Firebase Predictions and ML Kit were added, web developers could easily leverage the power and supremacy of Artificial Intelligence for augmenting the overall user experience delivered by their web apps.</p><span id="trend-the-jamstack-would-be-used-more-often" class="anchor-target"></span><h2 class="heading">Trend: The JAMstack Would Be Used More Often <a class="header-link" href="index.html#trend-the-jamstack-would-be-used-more-often">#</a></h2><hr>
<p>The JAMstack is gaining traction by the day and has become one of the most preferred ways of approaching building apps and websites that deliver amazing performance in an easy-to-scale and really cost-effective way. These apps generally are pretty simple in scope but there are instances where feature-rich apps have been developed and deployed by using the JAMstack.  The stack is known to serve pre-built files essentially over a CDN utilizing caches for superfast content loading. Third-party APIs were needed for generating dynamic data. As app developers are demonstrating their inclination for both lean architectures, as well as, development experiences, it is believed that the JAMstack is actually in the correct place at the correct time. In 2019, there surely would be tons of web apps and sites that would be developed and even deployed utilizing the JAMstack.</p><span id="trend-progressive-web-app" class="anchor-target"></span><h2 class="heading">Trend: Progressive Web App <a class="header-link" href="index.html#trend-progressive-web-app">#</a></h2><hr>
<p>Progressive Web Apps is certainly one of the hottest web application trends in 2019. These cutting-edge web applications are used to loading in the same manner as regular websites and web pages but they boast of a high functionality level. They are able to load almost instantly irrespective of the browser choice and network state simply because they have been built specially, with progressive enhancement, which is an effective stratagem for web design and focuses on core webpage content initially.</p><p>PWA provides an instant, reliable, and independent user experience minus any cache issues. It is totally safe as it is protected against data tampering and content snooping. Moreover, Progressive Web App is supposed to be easily installable, user-friendly, and totally hassle-free that helps in improving the currently existing web technologies because of its built-in features and service workers. It could be shared using a URL and could re-engage users with the help of web push notifications.</p><span id="conclusion" class="anchor-target"></span><h2 class="heading">Conclusion <a class="header-link" href="index.html#conclusion">#</a></h2><hr>
<p>We have discussed only some of the numerous technological advancements expected to take place in the web application development sector in 2019. Many of them have already been executed and some experimentation is going on with the others. The web application development has a bright and sunny, feature-rich and certainly more thrilling future ahead.</p>
