&lt;p&gt;Our final piece of advice is one that all athletes – no matter what sport or game they play – would say is crucially important. Hopefully, you will continue to rise through the ranks of your chosen game and become one of the very best. But you should never start thinking that there is no room for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like you should have watched videos of games and gamers when you were starting out, you should continue to stay ahead of the game. You should always be in the position to take more advice to become even better. Never stop learning and keep reaching for the stars.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://thepythonguru.com/tips-to-become-a-top-gamer/</guid></item><item><title>Choosing the Right Database Service: Factors to Consider for Scalability, Security, and Performance</title><link>https://thepythonguru.com/choosing-the-right-database-service-factors-to-consider-for-scalability-security-and-performance/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In an era where data reigns supreme, businesses face the crucial task of selecting the right database service to meet their evolving needs.

By adopting this approach, the number of direct DOM manipulations is minimized, leading to enhanced performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="reactive-data-binding" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Reactive Data Binding &lt;a class="header-link" href="#reactive-data-binding"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both frameworks provide reactive data binding. It means that the UI automatically updates when the underlying data changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="unidirectional-data-flow" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Unidirectional Data Flow &lt;a class="header-link" href="#unidirectional-data-flow"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React and Vue advocate for a unidirectional data flow. It entails dataflow in a single direction from parent components to child components. This pattern makes it easier to understand and track the data flow within the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="vibrant-ecosystem" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Vibrant Ecosystem &lt;a class="header-link" href="#vibrant-ecosystem"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both React and Vue have lively ecosystems with extensive community support. They offer numerous libraries, tools, and extensions that enhance developer productivity and allow seamless integration with other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="reusability-and-modularity" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Reusability and Modularity &lt;a class="header-link" href="#reusability-and-modularity"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, React and Vue emphasize reusability and modularity, allowing developers to encapsulate and reuse UI. It promotes code organization, maintainability, and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="developer-tools" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Developer Tools &lt;a class="header-link" href="#developer-tools"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.esparkinfo.com/blog/vue-vs-react.html"&gt;React and Vue&lt;/a&gt; provide robust developer tools and extensions for debugging, inspecting component hierarchy, and performance optimization. These tools enhance the development experience and aid in building high-quality applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="difference-between-react-and-vue" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;Difference Between React and Vue &lt;a class="header-link" href="#difference-between-react-and-vue"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React and Vue are popular JavaScript frameworks for building user interfaces in web applications. While they share some similarities, there are a few differences between React and Vue:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="approach-to-ui-development" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Approach to UI Development &lt;a class="header-link" href="#approach-to-ui-development"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React: React is a library focused solely on the view layer. It provides a declarative approach to building UIs, where developers define how the UI should look based on the application&amp;#39;s state. React embraces a component-based architecture that encourages the principles of reusability and modularity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vue: Vue is a framework that offers more out-of-the-box features for building UIs. It combines declarative rendering, component-based architecture, and a reactive data-binding system. Vue allows developers to define templates that blend HTML and JavaScript, making it easier to build UIs in collaboration with designers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="learning-curve" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Learning Curve &lt;a class="header-link" href="#learning-curve"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React: React has a steeper learning curve, especially for developers new to its concepts like JSX and the virtual DOM. Understanding concepts like state management and lifecycle methods can take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vue: Vue has a gentler learning curve, making it more approachable for beginners. Its syntax is intuitive and similar to traditional HTML and JavaScript. It helps make it easier to grasp and get started quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="ecosystem-and-community" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Ecosystem and Community &lt;a class="header-link" href="#ecosystem-and-community"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;React: React has a larger and more mature ecosystem with numerous libraries, tools, and community support. It has got Facebook&amp;#39;s back and solid industry experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vue: Vue has a growing and active community. Its ecosystem is not as extensive as compared to React.

&lt;li&gt;IoT implementations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data streaming platforms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex single-page apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Node.js is not recommended by experts for any CPU extensive&lt;a href="https://www.simform.com/services/web-apps-development/"&gt;web app development&lt;/a&gt;. Arguably many web development companies don&amp;#39;t recommend using this JavaScript runtime environment for projects with heavy server-side processing due to its imperfect tools, buggy npm modules, and libraries. It&amp;#39;ll be only wise to choose the right software development partner to assist you each step of your way to building extraordinary tech solutions for your enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is appropriate for both medium and large scale projects. Today the majority of tools rely upon Python for the data science industry. Python is suitable for a broad arena of projects ranging from web applications, statistical computations to machine learning and network programming. It&amp;#39;s an excellent programming language for executing diverse tasks. Python is used for several domains like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/uploads/2020/12/07/learning-curve.png" alt="Learning Curve .png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Web Development&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Image Processing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Educational Purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voice and Facial Recognition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software Testing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Visualization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Neural Networks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span id="3-community" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;#3. Community: &lt;a class="header-link" href="#3-community"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Node.js vibrant community is nothing short of astonishing itself with its enthusiastic crowd, always eager to help you and full of trusted developers. This passionate community is supported by many leading tech titans such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Node.js community is enormous and powerful. It is a mature, open-sourced language and now earned its spotlight amongst the user community. Over the years, millions of developers from all over the world have evolved to embrace and love this technology. As a business owner, it&amp;#39;s easy to find the right tech partners and Node.js developers while as a developer, you can look forward to peer support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/get-involved/"&gt;Node.js community&lt;/a&gt;, you can expect unlimited support from development experts worldwide to solve even the most uncommon development dilemmas. Many tech giants tech experts have taken up the baton and made notable contributions in offering solutions and supporting peers. Developers globally prefer using this technology as the community is just the perfect platform to showcase your talent by contributing to Node.js and its various packages, and also end up with better career opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is an open-source and interestingly quite mature and older technology than Node.js. It is only natural that both large user communities have a large number of active contributors with diverse levels of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sequentially, you profit from the extensive community, whether a business owner or you are a developer. When finding support and valuable resources, Python also has a helpful &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/community-landing/"&gt;community&lt;/a&gt;. Discussion boards and forums offer an excellent spot to post your queries and gain advice from fellow Python developers, opening new collaboration opportunities. For companies, it&amp;#39;s an ideal place to engage with the &lt;a href="https://www.simform.com/hire/python-developers/"&gt;top Python developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="4-learning-curve" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;#4. Learning Curve &lt;a class="header-link" href="#4-learning-curve"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node.js is undoubtedly one of the most famous and extensively used programming languages in the developer&amp;#39;s community. It is indeed recommended as easier to adapt and learn Node.js for web application development. Amongst developers, it seems like it&amp;#39;s a universal programming language. It requires lesser effort and time, even for a junior developer, to learn and work with Node.js. According to a &lt;a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted"&gt;StackOverflow survey&lt;/a&gt;, 66.8% of the professional developers opted for Node.js as the most preferred technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="RackMultipart20201016-4-1bzrp9d_html_b9b31fe3bcfdc408.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020%23most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted&amp;amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;amp;ust=1602748650661000&amp;amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGMJOvSe1d2_96k6bG-Ur4YP_tR9g"&gt;Stackflow 2020 Survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which is why exactly Node.js is so beloved amongst developers. Installing Node.js is simple, not really very complex to grasp the basics and eventually advance to the next level. Initially, it may be challenging to follow its event-driven architecture. Event-driven architecture has a significant impact on app performance; gradually, the developers master it with time and practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning Python is simple as it mostly teaches you to follow through the indented code in an organized structure with whitespace. It is quite whitespace sensitive. Developers often feel it&amp;#39;s tricky to manage the indentation as a single indentation error, or even a missed bracket can ruin the code flow for no apparent reason. It is quite complicated while troubleshooting these issues, not to forget it is also a time-consuming task. It is a little more challenging to install Python than Node.js, especially with macOS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="RackMultipart20201016-4-1bzrp9d_html_a44dbcf49225cf31.png" alt=""&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020%23most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted&amp;amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;amp;ust=1602748650661000&amp;amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGMJOvSe1d2_96k6bG-Ur4YP_tR9g"&gt;Stackflow 2020 Survey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is relatively less demanding with Windows or Linux. But with macOS, you are limited with interference with some system libraries when using Python 2.0. Make sure you configure the right version for the development environment. Writing code in Python might take fewer code lines, unlike Node.js. But this is not generally the case as it will uniquely depend on your project requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honestly, it&amp;#39;s tricky to measure up and conclude objectively, which is better as both Python and Node.js are simple and easy to learn. Maybe it all boils down to the project-specific requirements and customization you intend to offer to develop that particular project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="5-libraries" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;#5. Libraries &lt;a class="header-link" href="#5-libraries"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Node.js, NPM – the Node Package Manager plays a significant role. NPM is a very suffocated and indeed the world&amp;#39;s largest software registry. It handles the packages and libraries for Node.js. NPM is gradually evolving with the most well documented and swift for working with. It is easy to work with and full of ready-to-use codes, libraries, and packages. Over 1.3 million a staggering number of packages, extensive libraries, and a large pool of modules are readily available with a simple search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python, similarly to Node.js, has PIP &amp;quot;Pip installs Python&amp;quot; that manages packages and libraries. Pip is straightforward to use, reliable, and quick for the developers to learn and operate it. Python by pip is the default package installer for packages and libraries. Over 220 thousand packages across a broad spectrum and varied categories for data science, image processing, complex calculation, and much more serve your needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="6-error-handling" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;#6. Error Handling &lt;a class="header-link" href="#6-error-handling"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node.JS is very meticulous and efficient in error management. The tech has a reliable command in identifying exceptions occurring unpredictably at the time of code execution. The transparency and feasibility are very robust in terms of a programming tool in Node.js. Node.js has outstanding error management and has an excellent command to spot bugs and errors, reducing the chances of errors for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is equally powerful as Node.js when it comes to troubleshooting of sufficient errors and bugs. In Node.js vs. Python results for measuring error handling many debates, Python has the upper hand as it takes less time to spot errors and bugs in Python than Node.js. So for error management, developers won&amp;#39;t endure challenges in case project selection is Node.JS instead of Python for web app development. Moreover, it also exterminates the entire completion time and creates more feasibilities of time-to-market readiness in a single attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="7-performance" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;#7. Performance &lt;a class="header-link" href="#7-performance"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a super powerful V8 engine, Node.js increases performance vastly, making it lightning fast to interpret Javascript to machine language. Node.js reduces app loading time exponentially. Its feature of non-blocking event-driven architecture allows multiple concurrent requests to be processed quick and swift. The critical factor here for performance is the speed of your web application response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison to Python, Node.js definitely performs optimally in all memory-sensitive and performance-driven web applications. Node.js exceptional performance is mainly due to its ability to process code super fast for real-time applications. This performance factor dramatically influences the overall app user experience, likeability, and time-to-market as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all are aware that the faster the app loads, the better the app&amp;#39;s performance gets. Python is relatively slower in real-time app performance due to its ability to process a single thread at one time. When it comes to multiple complex calculations, you might want to consider Node.js as a better option for speed and performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simply put, in many use cases, you would not require performance to be your decisive parameter, such as if you are not developing a real-time app, so it would not directly influence user experience. Node.js web applications are much faster rather than python apps. It is a single stream programming language that prepares demands more gradually. Performance is the speed at which your web app replies, and this depends on how quickly your code collects and performs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="8-syntax" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;#8. Syntax &lt;a class="header-link" href="#8-syntax"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The syntax is an individual decision. You will encounter bunches of doubt and analysis on the off chance that you spot the better or more terrible one. The syntax for Node.js is very similar to the browser&amp;#39;s syntax for Javascript. Of course, according to the personal preference of the developer, it is aligned. We know a lot of our developers have faced our share of scepticism and criticism from our projects and readers as well. Truth be told, Node.js code structure is similar to JavaScript, making it familiar with the hurdles you might face with Node.js.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then again, for Python, syntax is a significant portion as programming engineers as you don&amp;#39;t have to create large code lines. Python&amp;#39;s syntax is relatively considerate and simple. With Python, developers need fewer lines of code in comparison to coding in Node.js. Python&amp;#39;s syntax structure is remarkably straightforward, even with its freedom to use curly brackets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="9-scalability" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;#9. Scalability &lt;a class="header-link" href="#9-scalability"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Node.js offers scalability organically as a default part of its runtime environment with the ability to handle the full power of your device with a cluster module to its advantage. Node.js spares you the wrath of creating a sizable monolithic core. The tech naturally allows you to scale the web application horizontally and vertically, making it preferred by many developers. Node.js readily offers scalability in an app&amp;#39;s ability to serve a large number of users with error-free performance. Using the &lt;a href="https://www.simform.com/best-nodejs-frameworks/"&gt;Node.js framework&lt;/a&gt; becomes seamless with total assurance for scalability. It offers that extra ease to create a set of microservices and modules, making the development process very flexible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is rather satisfactory. Python, on the other hand, is typically different from a reference to asynchronous programming. It lacks proper scalability to support runtime interpretation, making it a slower programming language. Python and Node.js both have very different ways to achieve scalability. Well, suitable for big services such as Reddit, Youtube, Pinterest, Dropbox, or even Quora.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="10-architecture" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;#10. Architecture &lt;a class="header-link" href="#10-architecture"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to Node.js architecture, it is organically designed as an event-driven runtime environment, which is paired with the asynchronous I/O. Due to its non-blocking nature from Node.js, it enables multiple concurrent connections without context switching. Node.js event-driven process is perfectly suitable for web app development for a real-time chat app, online games, data streaming platforms, and much more. Node.js architecture is a very sophisticated and highly preferred technology framework to build innovative web apps. Unlike the traditional web-serving technique where every request creates a new thread crapping the system in Node.js, it operates on a single thread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Python architecture is designed differently than Node.js. Python consists of a mix of tools that enables python developers to build an asynchronous and event-driven app. Few modules and libraries like &amp;#39;asyncio&amp;#39; help in writing the specific code for Python. Python doesn&amp;#39;t come with the built-in support libraries; it requires additional special tools. However, in Node.js, it is a part of the default libraries in-built at the installation time, which requires extra time to code with the module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="concluding-remarks" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;Concluding Remarks &lt;a class="header-link" href="#concluding-remarks"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When choosing the technology based on your project&amp;#39;s precise requirements, it is inevitable to consider all vital parameters. Python and Node.js both are amazing at their own place and have a variety of use cases. Hope this article addresses all those essential factors in comparing Python and Node.js; you might need to make the right decision according to your project demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Bio:&lt;/strong&gt; Hardik Shah works as a Tech Consultant at Simform, a leading software development company.

However, if you take a minute and read through this short post, you’ll see that there are some improvements to be made. The focus today will be on the Windows 10 operating system. Of course, we might have talked about an excellent tune-up utility/maintenance tool like this one: &lt;a href="https://antivirus-review.com/pc-matic-review"&gt;https://antivirus-review.com/pc-matic-review&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, we’ll go over the most significant steps that can improve performance and won’t cost you a penny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you think that your system is already running smoothly as butter, we still highly recommend putting the following tips to the test. Most likely, you’ve missed at least a couple, and they’ll make Win10 work that much faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="time-to-increase-your-systems-efficiency" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;Time to Increase Your System’s Efficiency &lt;a class="header-link" href="#time-to-increase-your-systems-efficiency"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;span id="get-the-latest-updates" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Get the latest updates &lt;a class="header-link" href="#get-the-latest-updates"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the simplest, yet, one of the essential things any Windows user should do. The Internet is changing rapidly, and unless you’ve got the newest updates running, performance won’t be optimal. Furthermore, you may fall victim to hacker attacks. By default, automatic updates are activated: that means the OS will download and install everything on its own. Still, we recommend manually checking for new releases every once in a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click Start, and go to the Settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, hit Update and Security – Win Updates&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you select &amp;quot;Check for Updates,&amp;quot; you’ll see the current system status&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If it says everything’s up to date, you’re fine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And if new updates are available, select &amp;quot;Install,&amp;quot; and Windows 10 will do the rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span id="change-the-page-file-size-settings" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Change the page file size settings &lt;a class="header-link" href="#change-the-page-file-size-settings"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python users know precisely what the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paging" rel="nofollow" &gt;Paging File&lt;/a&gt; is all about: it is hard-drive space reserved by the system and used as slow-speed memory. When Win 10 runs out of the RAM, it starts using the page file. In most situations, automatic management of the page file boosts the system’s performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Right-click on &amp;quot;This PC&amp;quot; on the desktop and select Properties – Advanced System Settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit Advanced – Performance – Settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Next, in Performance – click Advanced and select &amp;quot;Change&amp;quot; in Virtual Memory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, make sure automatic page file management is activated&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system will ask you to restart the computer: do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="manage-the-hard-drive-space" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Manage the hard-drive space &lt;a class="header-link" href="#manage-the-hard-drive-space"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, check how much free space is available on your hard drive(s). Go Start – Settings – System – Storage. One way to free up space is to use the Storage Sense feature. Don’t expect it to make any wonders happen, of course, but it can be instrumental sometimes. It’s Windows 10’s optimization tool, and it will delete duplicates and junk files from the system. In the menu, hit &amp;quot;Temporary files&amp;quot; and give the &amp;quot;Remove&amp;quot; command.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, run the Disc Cleanup tool (type its name in the taskbar search box, and launch it). Disc Cleanup allows selecting which types of files you want to get rid of. Temp Internet Files and Thumbnails are what you want to check first. The &amp;quot;Clean up system files&amp;quot; option can also free up a lot of space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="customize-onedrive-to-your-workflow" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Customize OneDrive to your workflow &lt;a class="header-link" href="#customize-onedrive-to-your-workflow"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When used properly, the OneDrive tool can be a life savior. For an active and &lt;a href="https://thepythonguru.com/8-must-have-skills-to-be-successful-python-developer/"&gt;successful Python user&lt;/a&gt;, it’s imperative to use the synchronization feature. First of all, that means you’ll never lose your files, as they’ll be backed up. Secondly, OneDrive allows access to that data from multiple devices. However, it’s also known to slow down performance, and that can be a problem. If that’s the case, it might be wise to put this feature on pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All you’ll have to do is right-click on OneDrive in the taskbar and go More – Pause Synching&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &amp;quot;Resume Synching&amp;quot; option will – yes, you guessed – bring syncing back to life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span id="say-no-to-non-essential-startup-apps" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Say no to non-essential startup apps &lt;a class="header-link" href="#say-no-to-non-essential-startup-apps"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ve all been there: over time, the list of startup programs gets unreasonably big. And you don’t need most of those apps. Moreover, you might not realize that they start with the OS and clutter the RAM, the CPU, and make everything work slower. So, go ahead and uncheck them all and only leave essential ones. First, check the taskbar: it’s probably full of program icons. 
The &amp;quot;Show hidden icons&amp;quot; command will reveal all the hidden apps. But that’s not all. Here’s how you can see the entire list of startup-approved programs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hit &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot; and go to Settings – Apps – Startup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Startup Area will appear on the screen. Just scroll down to the app(s) you want to exclude, and select &amp;quot;Off.&amp;quot;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span id="run-defragmentation-and-chkdsk" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h3 class="heading"&gt;Run defragmentation and CHKDSK &lt;a class="header-link" href="#run-defragmentation-and-chkdsk"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another common mistake against Python users (and developers in general): they forget the importance of disc maintenance. The experts recommend running full defragmentation of every single logical disc in the system at least once in two-three months. That will free up space and &amp;quot;tidy&amp;quot; everything up, resulting in a faster OS. As for &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/chkdsk"&gt;CHKDSK&lt;/a&gt;, it’s one of the oldest yet most effective tools.
Depending on your hardware and software, it may take a while to complete (especially if you have several hard discs installed). But, it will most certainly be worth it, as CHKDSK is pretty good at fixing logical file errors and verifying system integrity. Again, launch it regularly to keep Win 10 in good shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="about-the-author" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;About the Author &lt;a class="header-link" href="#about-the-author"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;

It’s a sought-after programming language in the field with a wide usage. According to the statistics, Python held &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/21017/most-popular-programming-languages/" rel="nofollow" &gt;29.9%&lt;/a&gt; of all tutorials searched for in Google, that’s really high popularity compared with Java (19.1%) and JavaScript (8.2%). Thus, it’s obvious that the professionals who know the coding language with all the nuances are in increasingly demand too. Yet, if you want to succeed as a Python dev in 2020, then there is a list of skills you are to master.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="who-is-a-python-developer" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;Who is a Python Developer? &lt;a class="header-link" href="#who-is-a-python-developer"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we start discussing and elaborating on the key skills of a Python developer, let&amp;#39;s define who he/she is and what he/she actually does. Python dev is not just a person with a high salary, but a professional with a composite of skills, experience, knowledge. Python developers are usually responsible for the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing server-side logic for platforms and web applications;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;developing various back-end components;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;deploying applications;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;performing usability, tuning, improvement, and automation;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gathering end-users’ requirements;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;collaborating with designers;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;writing reusable codes;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;debugging the project;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;working on the web frames, and so forth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;span id="12-key-skills-you-need-to-succeed-as-a-python-dev" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;12 Key Skills You Need to Succeed as a Python Dev &lt;a class="header-link" href="#12-key-skills-you-need-to-succeed-as-a-python-dev"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your goal is becoming a good/better Python developer, then it&amp;#39;s vital for you to have or master the following skills. So, let’s elaborate on the 12 key skills the big companies will check before hiring a Python developer in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="1-understanding-of-various-front-end-technologies" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;1 - Understanding of Various Front-end Technologies &lt;a class="header-link" href="#1-understanding-of-various-front-end-technologies"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re on your way of becoming a developer, then you&amp;#39;d get ready to communicate and collaborate with the front-end team. Therefore, you’d have an understanding of various frontend technologies. It&amp;#39;s needed for matching the server-side and client-side. Thus, knowledge of all limitations and possibilities of the front-end along with understanding the nuances of the app appearance can be pretty helpful for some projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="2-database-knowledge" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;2 - Database Knowledge &lt;a class="header-link" href="#2-database-knowledge"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skill set should also contain database knowledge. In addition to that, the developer should understand the fact that app performance and functionality heavily depend on how the app will be supported on the backend. Today a host of new styles of data storage systems is available that enhances the opportunities. Knowing the databases are essential for a good (really good one) Python dev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="3-mvc-mvt-architecture" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;3 - MVC-MVT Architecture &lt;a class="header-link" href="#3-mvc-mvt-architecture"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, a Python dev if he/she is a good one knows the difference between MVC (Model View Controller) and MVT (Model View Template) architecture. The difference is slight, but it does matter. So, if you wish to become better then you should learn the basics of multi-process architecture. It’s vital to have the ability to solve the problem in the core framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="4-javascript" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;4 - JavaScript &lt;a class="header-link" href="#4-javascript"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good Python developer is to have at least the basics of JavaScript. If you don&amp;#39;t have any, then it’s better to start... yesterday. Being a part of front-end technologies, JavaScript plays an important role in the appearance of the app. Besides, the knowledge of the coding language is vital for building interactive web interfaces. It’s because all the modern browsers come with built-in support for JavaScript. So, if you want to speak the same language with the front-end team, then get familiar with this programming language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="5-python-frameworks-and-libraries" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;5 - Python Frameworks and Libraries &lt;a class="header-link" href="#5-python-frameworks-and-libraries"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a host of the frameworks available for the coding. Certainly, it’s vital to be familiar with them and knowing all of them will be a huge plus. However, it&amp;#39;ll be enough to know the most used ones like Flask, Django, CherryPy.
Another thing the good dev should know is libraries. More hard-hitting workflow, faster execution of tasks, and other advantages come with the libraries used. Knowing and using the Python libraries can ease your developer life. So, you’d learn the libraries that can help with everyday tasks and depending on the project nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="6-version-control" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;6 - Version Control &lt;a class="header-link" href="#6-version-control"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case “push, commit, pull, fork” words make sense for you, then probably you have already properly set the GitHub. Yes, a good Python dev is to have the ability to track all the changes made in the source code. And these terms handle different versions. Mind that this skill is a must-have for all the companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="7-linux-and-macos-familiarity" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;7 - Linux and MacOS Familiarity &lt;a class="header-link" href="#7-linux-and-macos-familiarity"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not a secret that each OS has its own nuances and specifications. Python developers must know the differences and be familiar with some main requirements of MacOS and Linux. Just because if the app works well on Windows, then some crucial changes and implementations are needed for a smooth run on these very special OSs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="8-communication-analytical-and-design-skills" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;8 - Communication, Analytical and Design Skills &lt;a class="header-link" href="#8-communication-analytical-and-design-skills"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing brilliant codes is just a part of the developer&amp;#39;s job. Calls, meetings, co-working with other programmers, etc. are part of the job as well. The success of the entire project directly depends on how efficient the teammates can collaborate. So, this soft skill is essential in case you plan to be a better Python dev in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analytical skills are vital in case you wish to be a better Python dev in the future. Improving the skill, you will receive the ability to optimize the algorithms while coding, visualize datasets, have a good understanding of building useful websites, write clean code, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, you’d have strong design skills in case you crave to build scalable products. Understanding the basics of the good design, the Python developer can work well not only at the server-side, but at client-side as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="9-task-automation" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;9 - Task Automation &lt;a class="header-link" href="#9-task-automation"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lots of tasks are repetitive. Automation can solve a host of problems and free time for more important tasks that require more attention. Thus, it’s a perfect use case for a Python dev to automate the routine manual tasks such as gathering the data from the database, reporting, etc. Moreover, instead of spending hours on writing the code, you can choose the right automation tool. That makes the skill important for developers to be more proactive and effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="10-debug-and-unit-test-skills" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;10 - Debug and Unit Test Skills &lt;a class="header-link" href="#10-debug-and-unit-test-skills"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the requirements, Python developers should know how to test and debug a system. Actually, debugging is a part of the Python developer’s job. It can save a lot of time for the entire team as well. Writing the code, you’d think over the unit test to reveal the bug on the early stage before it becomes critical. So, if you’re going to be better, then improve the skill in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="11-integration-ability" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;11 - Integration Ability &lt;a class="header-link" href="#11-integration-ability"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s common when the developers are to work with multiple databases and data sources simultaneously. That’s why Python devs should know how to integrate all of them into the single system. Besides, the developer should do it smoothly with a minimum of discrepancies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="12-multiple-delivery-platforms-understanding" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;12 - Multiple Delivery Platforms Understanding &lt;a class="header-link" href="#12-multiple-delivery-platforms-understanding"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today there is a host of devices for delivery, lots of desktop variations and mobile gadgets, and each device has its own specifications to take into consideration. As a Python dev, you&amp;#39;d know the difference between the gadgets and have an ability to optimize the output to meet the requirements and fit the target platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="bottom-line" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;Bottom line &lt;a class="header-link" href="#bottom-line"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is an extremely popular programming language due to its features, opportunities, fields of usage. Yet, you&amp;#39;re to have a wide range of skills to become a good or better Python developer in 2020. The skills mentioned and described in the article are a few ones, but the key ones. Each company can enhance the list actually. If you think of becoming a Python dev and dream about a massive salary in 2020, then master each skill mentioned. Don&amp;#39;t stop on these points, go further to head over your competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexey Kutsenko is CMO and Employer Brand Specialist at &lt;a href="http://ddi-dev.com" rel="nofollow" &gt;DDI Development Company&lt;/a&gt;.

Many companies have begun to use it as a means of shipping code in minutes and making sure everything electronic is running smoothly. This has increased the general interest in CI/CD greatly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept behind &lt;a href="https://semaphoreci.com/cicd" rel="nofollow" &gt;continuous integration&lt;/a&gt; is to give coders and workers the ability to continuously enter new code into one system so that the code and systems are constantly updating. This has helped move online companies and businesses with an online market or customer service center work more efficiently and more securely on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery is the other half of this coin that makes it so easy to receive and transport new code and data. Integration makes it easy to enter and check new code multiple times a day so your company can always improve, but continuous delivery is what makes it possible to have new code coming in and pushing your business into the next improvement as quickly and safely as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CI/CD is one of the most influential changes in the business world over the last decade. The ability to be constantly changing and updating your business was unheard of just a few years ago. Here are a few of the reasons you should be using CI/CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="1-continuous-testing" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;1. Continuous Testing &lt;a class="header-link" href="#1-continuous-testing"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the excellent features that come with using CI/CD is the constant testing of the new code. Programmers and coders used to have to put in huge chunks of code as quickly as possible and then deal with the inevitable bugs that come with entering that much code at once with no ability to check if it is all working together. That is why CI/CD includes testing as the code is entered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helps stop bugs in the system before they even start as you will be altered if some of the code is not quite right for your system. The early warning saves time and money for your business and your coders who will not have to go back and check all the code to find where the bug is. CI/CD informs them where the problem is and often stops the issue before it can even start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any coder will tell you that one of &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/aj-agrawal/why-the-hardest-part-of-coding-is-getting-unstuck-4-tips.html#:~:text=The%20hardest%20part%20of%20learning,less%20technical%20and%20more%20psychological.&amp;amp;text=Businesses%20are%20hiring%20great%20web,the%20education%20and%20hiring%20sector." rel="nofollow" &gt;the most frustrating parts&lt;/a&gt; of coding is having to go through the whole thing to find the problem. Continuous testing has made that process much easier and quicker than ever before. The continuous testing makes sure your code is safe and correct even as it is being entered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="2-short-code" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;2. Short Code &lt;a class="header-link" href="#2-short-code"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The continuous integration of CI/CD has many benefits. One of these includes the ability to insert much shorter chunks of code than ever would have been entered before. This makes it much easier to test the code and find any mistakes almost immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code used to have to be entered in big chunks as it was finished and written so the whole system would be able to work together. Continuous integration has made it so smaller amounts of code can be added throughout the day. You still have the whole system running together but are able to check for mistakes and fix the code as it is being entered. This saves time and makes it much easier for developers to keep up with the insane amount of code that goes into making any system run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers and development teams often work in separate locations or even remotely. Being able to integrate small chunks of code and fix them as they are entered allows for developers to be able to work as a team to keep systems running smoothly even if they are far away from each other and the main system. This has made developers’ jobs much more efficient and been very helpful in helping manage a big development team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="3-quick-release" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;3. Quick Release &lt;a class="header-link" href="#3-quick-release"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because CI/CD allows for much more code to be entered and checked quickly, you are also able to release new systems much sooner than you would have before. System failures are detected faster and fixed because it is easier to locate the problem among small chunks of code. This actually makes the whole process, including the release of the new system updates, go much quicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this increased rate of system release is only possible due to the quicker identification of problems in the code. This means that system updates and improvements and can be released quickly and frequently as long as your system is also constantly being given new code and information. The continuous update of code and information makes it simple to release more updates at a faster rate than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CI/CD is a system that is able to merge new lines of code with the old system while checking for mistakes or possible bugs. This makes it easier to release new updates with fewer mistakes. It also makes it possible to release updates one right after the other in a way that was never possible before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="4-fast-mttr" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;4. Fast MTTR &lt;a class="header-link" href="#4-fast-mttr"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/uploads/2020/09/13/image2.jpg" alt="image2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MTTR, or Mean Time To Resolution, is a process of measuring the time that it takes to repair broken features. It also measures how maintainable a recently fixed or updated feature actually is. That means, in simple terms, MTTR measures how long it takes to repair broken codes and systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CI/CD uses smaller chunks of code and checks it as the code is entered. This makes isolating any issue with the code easier than ever before. You can find the smaller chunks of code and identify where the problem is without having to sift through the entire block of code that might have taken months to type out. Everything is smaller, faster, and more efficient than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means CI/CD has shortened the MTTR quite drastically in many businesses. Keeping disaster and problems to a minimum is always the goal in a functioning business. That is why the shortened MTTR time is such a winning benefit of using CI/CD processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="5-small-backlog" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;5. Small Backlog &lt;a class="header-link" href="#5-small-backlog"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backlog of code that is used to make anything run smoothly and without bugs is enormous. Anyone who isn’t a developer would be amazed by the amount of code that needs to be used to make even the simplest features run correctly. That is why CI/CD is a great process not only for businesses but for the developers that make the coding and system updates possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are often non-critical issues in code that are missed as developers are looking for big issues that could ruin the whole system. These are the kind of bugs that make a system just a little glitchy and slow. They are also the issues that are hardest to find in the huge blocks of code that fill the backlog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CI/CD checks and points out these small problems as the smaller blocks of code are entered into the system. That means the small bugs can be quickly identified and fixed leaving more time for developers and testers to focus on big problems with the system instead of hunting for small, annoying bugs in the code. Having small problems easily identified so more time can be spent fixing the big issues makes system updates better and helps release them quicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="6-quick-feedback" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;6. Quick Feedback &lt;a class="header-link" href="#6-quick-feedback"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A place where many online ventures and shops suffer is customer feedback. It is a difficult and annoying process for the customer to provide feedback and it can be difficult for the company to go through all of the complaints to find common issues. The same can actually be said for the developers themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there is a problem with the code or system it can be difficult for the developers to narrow down the issue and report it as a problem. It is also often an annoying process that developers avoid in order to avoid wasting their own time. This makes it harder to keep the systems running smoothly and know what needs to be updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CI/CD is a two-part system made to make it easier for both developers and customers to receive results and be able to critique the system quickly and efficiently. CI is focused on the development team so this stage is a time where developers can find problems and fix them easily. CD is the quick release that allows customers, the main users of the system update, to be able to receive and review the end product quickly and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="7-customer-satisfaction" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;7. Customer Satisfaction &lt;a class="header-link" href="#7-customer-satisfaction"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quick turn around in system issues and back to back system updates make your whole customer experience run smoothly. The first few hours of a system update are crucial. In those moments the people who use your features will find any bugs and know if they like the new updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You never want to ruin those &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2019/06/18/customer-experiences-define-success-in-a-digital-first-world/#67688f4fd484" rel="nofollow" &gt;first few customer experiences&lt;/a&gt; with problems in the system. That leads to dissatisfaction and bad reviews that can be difficult to come back from. This is why CI/CD provides so much customer satisfaction immediately after a system update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bugs have already been checked. The issues that might have been missed with bigger chunks of code that needed to all be checked for problems at once have been solved. This provides quick updates to satisfy customers. All without the bugs that might have occured before your developers were able to check the code as they went and find issues before they arose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="8-save-money" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;8. Save Money &lt;a class="header-link" href="#8-save-money"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because CI/CD is catching problems early and helping developers find the bugs before they become an issue, it is saving your developers time. If time is money, as the old business adage goes, then this is a huge money saver for your company. Quicker problem analysis and a faster solving time mean your developers have more time to create and input new code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This constant improvement of your systems and features through new code will keep your company at the front of innovation. The constant checking and solving of problems in your code will help developers start issues before they form quicker than they ever would have been able to before. This gives developers the time they might have been spending searching for issues in code to use on creating better systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More code and newer, quicker system updates create a better customer experience. This raises profits while also making sure you are not paying developers for solving issues that could have been found much quicker using the CI/CD system. A constantly improving system is impressive to customers. It will likely increase both customer and employee satisfaction in a way that is sure to make you and &lt;a href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/maximizing-customer-satisfaction-maximize-profitability-35724.html#:~:text=Customer%20satisfaction%20helps%20to%20increase,for%20additional%20revenue%20and%20profit." rel="nofollow" &gt;save you more money&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="9-simple-maintenance" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;9. Simple Maintenance &lt;a class="header-link" href="#9-simple-maintenance"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every system, no matter how well checked before it is implemented, is going to need maintenance. This is true for any program or system that gets a lot of traffic and is used heavily by customers. The code and system will need to be maintained and checked regularly for new issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because CI/CD is laid out in an easy format with small chunks of code and a smaller backlog, those issues are much easier to locate and repair. Even system updates that were implemented several months prior are integrated into the current system through CI/CD and could suffer issues that affect the current system code. That is why the concise layout of code that CI/CD uses is so valuable when looking through old code to maintain the system your developers have built.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this maintenance may have to be done during light traffic hours on your system. Maintenance often causes problems as it is being done which can lead to a slower and worse customer experience which is why it is so important that CI/CD makes it easy and quick to maintain your system. This way you can do maintenance during low traffic hours and do it quickly enough that very few or even no customers will be affected by the updates and problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;span id="conclusion" class="anchor-target"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;h2 class="heading"&gt;Conclusion &lt;a class="header-link" href="#conclusion"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/media/uploads/2020/09/13/image3.jpg" alt="image3.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CI/CD is a system that was created to make life easier for developers. It allows for quicker system updates, easier problem solving, better customer experience, and faster input and output of new systems than ever before. These valuable benefits make CI/CD an amazing tool to add efficiency to your business and increase your bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid>https://thepythonguru.com/9-reasons-why-you-should-use-cicd/</guid></item></channel></rss>
